What to pack:<br>
“The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.”<br>
- said Mark Twain never! While usually attributed to him, there is no evidence that he ever said this. The actual source of these words is unknown.<br>
<br>
San Francisco has moderate climate all year long. Expect to see fog (https://twitter.com/karlthefog) during the summer. Bring a jacket for the evenings.<br>
